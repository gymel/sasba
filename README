NAME
    SeeAlso::Source::BeaconAggregator - Beacon files as source for
    SeeAlso::Server

DESCRIPTION
    This Module allows a collection of BEACON files (cf.
    http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:PND/BEACON) to be used as
    SeeAlso::Source (probably in the context of an SeeAlso::Server
    application). Therefore it implements the four methods documented in
    SeeAlso::Source

    The BEACON files (lists of non-local identifiers of a certain type
    documenting the coverage of a given online database plus means for
    access) are imported by the methods provided by
    SeeAlso::Source::BeaconAggregator::Maintenance.pm, usually by employing
    the script sasbactrl.pl as command line client.

    Serving other formats than SeeAlso or providing a BEACON file with
    respect to this SeeAlso service is achieved by using
    SeeAlso::Source::BeaconAggregator::Publisher.
